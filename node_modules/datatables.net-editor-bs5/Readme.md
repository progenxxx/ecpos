## Editor NPM Bootstrap 5 styling holding package

[Editor](https://editor.datatables.net) is an extension for the [DataTables Javascript library](https://datatables.net) which adds full editing abilities to a DataTable, including row creation and deletion, multi-row editing, inline and bubble editing and full integration with Bootstrap, Foundation, Semantic UI and others. Full details and live examples for Editor can be found on [its web-site](https://editor.datatables.net).


## Installing Editor

Editor can be installed through several different methods:

1. [The DataTables Editor NPM repository](https://editor.datatables.net/manual/installing/#NPM-package-manager)
2. [Direct inclusion from download files](https://editor.datatables.net/manual/installing/#Direct-inclusion)
3. Through this package and an install script from the `datatables.net-editor` package.

Editor is not suitable for inclusion on npm.com due to its commercial nature, thus if you choose option three from the above, you need to install the npm holding packages (such as this one) and then run an install script to copy the Editor files from your _zip_ download from [the Editor web-site](https://editor.datatables.net/download) into the relevant npm packages.

We strongly recommend using the DataTables Editor NPM repository if you are installing Editor with NPM / Yarn / etc, to avoid this installation step.
